# Overriding
Simple Program in Overriding in Java.
Method overriding can only occur in a superclass-subclass relationship (Inheritance). There will be situations where you extend a class and you want to modify the behavior of a method declared in the superclass. Both in superclass and subclass overriden method must be same signatures and return type. If any method is not found in the subclass then look to superclass.
